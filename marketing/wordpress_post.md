<p class="has-drop-cap">Have you ever wondered why there seem to be contradictions in the Bible regarding salvation? Why did Jesus tell His disciples not to go to the Gentiles, but Paul became the apostle to the Gentiles? Why did Peter preach baptism for the remission of sins, while Paul emphasized salvation by grace through faith?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These apparent contradictions disappear when we understand a critical principle of Bible study: <strong>rightly dividing the word of truth</strong> (2 Timothy 2:15). Today, I'm excited to introduce a new tool designed specifically to help Bible students understand and explore these distinctions.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Two Gospels in Scripture</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bible contains two primary gospel messages that were preached to different audiences at different times:</p>

<h3>The Kingdom Gospel</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Preached by Jesus and His disciples</li><li>Directed specifically to Israel</li><li>Focused on the coming Kingdom on earth</li><li>Required repentance, baptism, and keeping the law</li><li>Promised restoration of Israel's kingdom</li></ul>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>"And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people."</p><cite>Matthew 4:23 (KJV)</cite></blockquote>

<!-- wp:column {"backgroundColor":"pale-pink"} -->
<div class="wp-block-column has-pale-pink-background-color has-background">
<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>The Grace Gospel</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Revealed to and through the Apostle Paul</li><li>Directed to all people, both Jews and Gentiles</li><li>Focused on the mystery of the Church, the Body of Christ</li><li>Based on grace through faith apart from works</li><li>Promised heavenly citizenship and spiritual blessings</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>"For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast."</p><cite>Ephesians 2:8-9 (KJV)</cite></blockquote>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Recognizing these distinctions is not about creating division or suggesting contradictions in God's Word. Rather, it's about understanding God's different programs for different peoples at different times. This approach, often associated with dispensational Bible study, helps us correctly interpret and apply Scripture.</p>

<h3>Example: Searching for "Gospel"</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let's say you search for the word "gospel." The tool will show you verses like:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:group {"backgroundColor":"light-green-cyan"} -->
<div class="wp-block-group has-light-green-cyan-background-color has-background">
<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>Kingdom Gospel Results:</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Matthew 4:23 - "And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the <mark>gospel</mark> of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Matthew 9:35 - "And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the <mark>gospel</mark> of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
</div>
<!-- /wp:group -->

<!-- wp:group {"backgroundColor":"light-gray"} -->
<div class="wp-block-group has-light-gray-background-color has-background">
<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>Grace Gospel Results:</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Galatians 2:7 - "But contrariwise, when they saw that the <mark>gospel</mark> of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as the <mark>gospel</mark> of the circumcision was unto Peter;"</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Romans 1:16 - "For I am not ashamed of the <mark>gospel</mark> of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
</div>
<!-- /wp:group -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Notice how the gospel in Matthew is specifically called "the gospel of the kingdom," while Paul refers to "the gospel of the uncircumcision" and "the gospel of Christ." These distinct terms point to the different messages that were preached.</p>
