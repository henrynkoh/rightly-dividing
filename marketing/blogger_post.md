## Understanding the Two Gospels in Scripture

One of the most overlooked keys to understanding the Bible is recognizing that Scripture contains two distinct gospel messages:

1. **The Kingdom Gospel** - Preached by Jesus and the disciples to Israel
2. **The Grace Gospel** - Revealed to Paul for both Jews and Gentiles

This isn't just a theological curiosity—it's essential for properly interpreting God's Word. As Paul instructed Timothy:

> "Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth." - 2 Timothy 2:15 (KJV)

But how can you easily study these differences? That's why we created the **Rightly Dividing Bible Analysis Tool**.

## Introducing Our Free Bible Analysis Tool

Today, we're excited to announce the release of a new web-based application designed specifically for studying the distinctions between the Kingdom and Grace gospels in the King James Version Bible.

Our tool allows you to:

- **Search any word or phrase** across the entire KJV Bible
- **See instant categorization** of verses by gospel type
- **Highlight search terms** automatically within verse text
- **Toggle Korean translations** for bilingual study
- **Upload your own data** if you want to customize verse classifications

Best of all, it's completely free to use, requires no signup, and works on any device with a web browser.

## The Evidence in Scripture

Consider these contrasting passages:

**Kingdom Gospel:**
> "These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not: But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel." - Matthew 10:5-6

> "And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people." - Matthew 4:23

**Grace Gospel:**
> "For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast." - Ephesians 2:8-9

> "But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as the gospel of the circumcision was unto Peter;" - Galatians 2:7

These aren't contradictions—they're evidence of God's different programs for Israel and the Church.
