Have you ever wondered why Jesus told His disciples "go NOT to the Gentiles" (Matt 10:5) but Paul was the "apostle to the Gentiles" (Rom 11:13)?

This isn't a contradiction—it's a KEY to understanding Scripture.

We've built a tool to help you study these differences.

The Kingdom Gospel vs. The Grace Gospel:

KINGDOM 👑
- Preached by Jesus to Israel
- "Repent, for the kingdom is at hand"
- Law still in effect
- Required baptism

GRACE ✝️
- Revealed to Paul for all
- "Believe and be saved by grace"
- "Not under law but under grace"
- One baptism by the Spirit
