## ANNOUNCING: Our New Bible Analysis Tool

![Rightly Dividing Tool Banner]

Dear Bible Student,

We're excited to announce the release of our **Rightly Dividing Bible Analysis Tool** - a free web-based application designed to help you study the differences between the Kingdom Gospel and Grace Gospel in the King James Version Bible.

## Why Rightly Divide?

In 2 Timothy 2:15, Paul instructs believers to "study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, **rightly dividing the word of truth**."

But what does it mean to "rightly divide" the word of truth?

One of the most important divisions in Scripture is between the **Kingdom Gospel** that Jesus preached to Israel and the **Grace Gospel** that was later revealed to Paul for all people. Understanding this distinction clears up many apparent contradictions and helps us correctly interpret God's Word.

## Featured Verse Comparison

**Search Term: "Salvation"**

**Kingdom Gospel:**
> "But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved." - Matthew 24:13

**Grace Gospel:**
> "For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast." - Ephesians 2:8-9

Notice the different conditions for salvation in these verses. In the Kingdom Gospel, enduring to the end was required. In the Grace Gospel, salvation is by grace through faith, not of works.

## Quick Tip

Try searching for "gospel" and notice how it's often called "the gospel of the kingdom" in Matthew, but "the gospel of the grace of God" in Acts 20:24 when Paul speaks.
