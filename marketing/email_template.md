# Introducing the Rightly Dividing Bible Analysis Tool

Dear [First Name],

Have you ever noticed these apparent contradictions in Scripture?

- Jesus told His disciples "go NOT unto the Gentiles" (Matthew 10:5), yet Paul was the "apostle to the Gentiles" (Romans 11:13)
- Peter preached "repent and be baptized" (Acts 2:38), while Paul emphasized "believe and be saved by grace" (Ephesians 2:8-9)
- Jesus said He came "not to destroy the law" (Matthew 5:17), but Paul wrote we are "not under law but under grace" (Romans 6:14)

These aren't contradictions—they're evidence of God's different messages for different people at different times. This is what Paul meant when he instructed us to be "rightly dividing the word of truth" (2 Timothy 2:15).
